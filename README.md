#Proposal

#Finalize one capstone idea based on the feedback that you received on your initial ideas and your discussions with your mentor.
#The proposal should address the following questions:
#What is the problem you want to solve?
#Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis 
#that they wouldn’t have done otherwise?
#What data are you using? How will you acquire the data?
#Briefly outline how you’ll solve this problem. Your approach may change later, but this is a good first step to get you thinking about #a method and solution.
#What are your deliverables? Typically, this includes code, a paper, or a slide deck.

#Data Wrangling

#Now that you have a basic ideas of the various data wrangling steps and techniques available, let's apply it to your capstone project.
#The first step in completing your capstone project is to collect data. Depending on your dataset, you may apply some of the data 
#wrangling techniques that you learned in this unit. Some of you may be using standard datasets and sources, such as Kaggle or Yelp, 
#where minimal or no data wrangling is required. Students often find that this part of the project takes a lot longer than they 
#estimated, which is completely normal. The more work you put in, the more you’ll learn. Data wrangling is an important tool in a data 
#scientist’s toolbox!  
#Steps:
#Create a Google Doc (1-2 pages) describing the data wrangling steps you took to clean the dataset. Include answers to these questions #in your submission:
#What kind of cleaning steps did you perform?
#How did you deal with missing values, if any?
#Were there outliers, and how did you handle them?
#Submit a link to the document.
#Discuss it with your mentor at the next call.
#Revise and resubmit if needed.
#Convert the final document to a .pdf and add it to your GitHub repository for this project. This document will eventually become part #of your milestone report.

#Data Storytelling

#How do you create a data story? You’ve learned the basics, but the information is probably a bit abstract at this point. Keep in mind 
#that storytelling is an art, so you have to get your imagination bubbling. In this project, you’ll learn some pointers to get those 
#creative juices flowing. In the following sections, we’ll work step-by-step to create your first data story. 
#Steps:
#Ask the following questions and look for the answers using code and plots:
#Can you count something interesting?
#Can you find trends (e.g. high, low, increasing, decreasing, anomalies)?
#Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
#Can you compare two related quantities?
#Can you make a scatterplot?
#Can you make a time-series plot?
#Looking at the plots, what are some insights you can make? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you’d like to investigate 
#further? What other questions do the insights lead you to ask?
#Now that you’ve asked questions, hopefully you’ve found some interesting insights. Is there a narrative or a way of presenting the 
#insights using text and plots that tells a compelling story? What are some other trends/relationships you think will make the story #more complete?
